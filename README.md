# CollegeSearchAPI

CollegeSearchAPI is a backend service designed to facilitate searching and retrieving information about colleges. It provides a set of RESTful API endpoints to help users discover and query college data efficiently.

## Project Overview

The CollegeSearchAPI allows users and applications to:
- Search for colleges based on various criteria (name, location, course offerings, etc.)
- Access detailed information about colleges
- Integrate college data into other platforms and services

The API is built with scalability and ease of integration in mind, making it suitable for educational platforms, admission portals, or any service requiring college data.

## Deployment Procedures

To deploy the CollegeSearchAPI, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ashis32/collegesearchAPI.git
cd collegesearchAPI
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have the appropriate version of Node.js or Python (check the codebase for the tech stack), then run:

For Node.js:
```bash
npm install
```

For Python (if applicable):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary configuration variables such as database connection strings, API keys, etc.

Example:
```
DB_URI=your_database_uri
PORT=5000
```

### 4. Run Database Migrations (if any)

If the project uses migrations, run them before starting the API:

For Node.js (TypeORM/Sequelize):
```bash
npm run migrate
```

For Python (Alembic/Django):
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Start the Server

For Node.js:
```bash
npm start
```

For Python:
```bash
python app.py
```
or
```bash
gunicorn app:app
```

### 6. Verify Deployment

Once the server is running, access the API endpoints at:

```
http://localhost:PORT/
```

Replace `PORT` with the value specified in your `.env` file.

## Notes

- For production deployment, consider using Docker, a process manager (like PM2 for Node.js), and HTTPS.
- Refer to the source code and comments for further details regarding customization and configuration.
- Keep your environment variables secure and never commit them to version control.

Happy coding!
